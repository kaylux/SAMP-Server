# SAMP Server



This script is over 5k lines of code. This script was used a popular server on the unofficial multiplayer mod for GTA SA called 'SAMP'.

The script was a simple, yet effective and fun mini-game that involved stealing vans from the other gangs side of town and attempting to drive them back to your HQ without being killed. The other gang would also be attempting the same.
This script was originally developed to work on a file system, storing each players data while they were not online so that they could return with the same stats, it was then converted to be fully MySQL dependant, even down to various server logs.
